## Description
Iron-air is reversible rusting used as grid storage. Iron electrodes oxidize to iron hydroxide while an air electrode reduces oxygen on discharge, and the process reverses on charge. Iron is the cheapest energy-storage material on earth, so iron-air targets 100-hour multi-day storage at a capital cost per kWh far below anything lithium can reach. The price you pay for that is low efficiency and very low power density.

## Strengths and weaknesses
Energy capacity cost could reach roughly $20/kWh. The inputs are iron, water, and air, so there is no supply-chain risk, and the cells are non-flammable. That gets you into a long-duration niche that lithium economics cannot serve. Weaknesses: round-trip efficiency is around 40–50%, because hydrogen evolves on charge; the footprint per MW is massive; response is slow, so it suits energy services rather than power services; and air-electrode durability across thousands of cycles is still the hard engineering problem, so nobody has published a fielded cycle life.

## When to use
Pick iron-air only for multi-day firming (100-hour-class discharge on renewable-heavy grids), where capacity cost per kWh is what matters, charging happens on surplus power that makes 40–50% efficiency tolerable, and land is available for the footprint. Treat it as an energy asset rather than a power asset: don't spec it for daily cycling, fast response, or ancillary services. If your duration runs up to roughly 8–12 hours, LFP (or flow batteries at the margin) is the answer, and iron-air only starts to make sense where their tank-and-container economics run out.

## Key numbers
Discharge duration up to 100 hours · round-trip efficiency 40–50% · target energy capacity cost around $20/kWh · cell voltage around 1 V · response measured in minutes rather than milliseconds · no published cycle life yet.

## Examples
Form Energy's 100-hour systems — Cambridge, Minnesota (Great River Energy) and multiple utility pilots, with a West Virginia factory; ESS-adjacent academic iron-electrode programs.

## Economic profile
The bet is that decarbonized grids will pay for multi-day firming that daily-cycling lithium cannot provide, and that a 40–50%-efficient battery is acceptable when charged on surplus renewable power. Market timing is the risk: the multi-day storage market barely exists yet, and gas peakers with capture, hydrogen, and transmission all compete for the same role.
