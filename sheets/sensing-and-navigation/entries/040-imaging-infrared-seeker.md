## Description
An imaging infrared seeker carries a focal plane array rather than a single detector, so it sees a picture rather than a modulated brightness. That changes the problem from tracking a hot spot to recognizing a shape. The seeker can reject a flare because a flare does not look like an aircraft, it can select a specific aimpoint on a vehicle — engine deck, turret ring — and it can perform automatic target recognition against stored templates. Resolution of 256×256 to 640×512 in the 3–5 µm or 8–12 µm band is typical.

## Strengths and weaknesses
Countermeasure resistance and aimpoint selection are the advantages, and they are large: an imaging seeker rejects the flares and much of the directed-infrared jamming that defeat reticle seekers, and hitting a specific part of a target changes lethality substantially. It also enables true fire-and-forget attack against ground targets. The weaknesses are cost and weather. A cooled imaging seeker costs several times a reticle seeker, and every infrared band still loses range in cloud, rain, and smoke. Automatic target recognition performance against unexpected target configurations remains the soft spot, and it is hard to test honestly.

## When to use
Pick an imaging infrared seeker where countermeasure resistance or precise aimpoint selection justifies the cost: top-attack anti-armor missiles, modern air-to-air missiles, and precision strike weapons against distinct targets. If the target is a large emitter in clear weather and cost matters, a simpler seeker will do. If weather is the dominant risk, pair imaging infrared with millimeter-wave radar in a dual-mode seeker — the radar finds the target through obscurants and the imager confirms the aimpoint, which is now the standard architecture for high-end anti-armor weapons.

## Key numbers
Focal plane array 256×256 to 640×512 · 3–5 µm or 8–12 µm band · detector cooled to roughly 77 K by a Stirling cooler · dual-mode versions pair it with a 94 GHz millimeter-wave radar · several times the cost of a reticle seeker, dominated by the array and its cooler.

## How it is defeated
Multispectral smoke and obscurants block it. Thermal signature management reduces contrast, and decoys designed to present a plausible thermal shape rather than just a hot spot are effective if well made. High-power directed infrared countermeasures can still dazzle or damage the array. Automatic target recognition can be defeated by presenting targets in configurations outside its training set, which is the practical version of an adversarial attack and is much easier than the academic literature makes it sound.

## Examples
Javelin's imaging seeker, the AIM-9X and IRIS-T, the Spike family, Brimstone's dual-mode seeker, the Python-5, and the terminal seekers on several loitering munitions.

## Economic profile
Imaging seeker cost is dominated by the cooled focal plane array and its cooler, which are the same components as high-end thermal imaging and share that concentrated supply base. Prices have fallen as detector production has matured, which has moved imaging seekers from exquisite weapons into much broader use, including relatively inexpensive loitering munitions. Export control remains strict, and the seeker is often the item that gates a weapon transfer.
