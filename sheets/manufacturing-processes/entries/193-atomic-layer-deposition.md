## Description

Sequential self-limiting reactions deposit one atomic-scale layer at a time.

## Strengths and weaknesses

Provides very tight thickness control and excellent conformality. Deposition is slow and precursor chemistry is expensive.

## When to use

Use ALD when the film is thin (typically 1 to 50 nm) and has to be perfectly conformal or thickness-controlled at the single-nanometer level: high-k gate dielectrics, liners and barriers in high-aspect-ratio vias and 3D NAND structures, pinhole-free moisture barriers on OLEDs, and protective coatings inside porous electrodes. Its self-limiting chemistry coats aspect ratios beyond 100:1 that no CVD process reaches, and low process temperatures suit polymers and sensitive devices. Growth runs at roughly 0.1 nm per cycle, so anything beyond ~100 nm is very slow and expensive in precursor. Use CVD for thick conformal films and PVD for simple planar metals, and consider spatial ALD only when a specific thin film has to cover large areas quickly.

## Key numbers

Film thickness typically 1–50 nm · growth about 0.1 nm per cycle with cycles of 0.5–10 seconds, so roughly 30–300 nm per hour · conformality above 95% at aspect ratios past 100:1 · thickness uniformity within about 1% across a wafer · deposition temperature 50–350 °C, low enough for polymers · tools roughly $300k to $2M, with hafnium and zirconium precursors at thousands of dollars per kilogram.

## Examples

Gate dielectrics, battery coatings, nanoscale barriers.

## Economic profile

Growth of roughly 30–300 nm per hour makes ALD the slowest deposition method in the fab, so it is used only where nothing else gives conformality above 95% at aspect ratios past 100:1. Precursors are the unusual cost: hafnium and zirconium compounds run to thousands of dollars per kilogram, high enough that precursor utilization gets engineered rather than accepted. Tools at $300k to $2M are modest by fab standards, and throughput is what constrains the process.
