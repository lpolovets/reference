## Description

A laser fuses polymer powder in a bed, with unfused powder supporting the part.

## Strengths and weaknesses

Produces complex functional polymer parts without dedicated supports. Surface finish is grainy, machines are expensive, and powder management is substantial.

## When to use

Pick polymer powder-bed fusion for functional end-use nylon parts (snap fits, ducts, brackets, orthotics) from prototypes into bridge production of hundreds to a few thousand units. Parts nest densely in the bed with no supports, and properties are far more isotropic than FFF. It is the standard way to ship real plastic parts before or instead of cutting a mold. If you need smooth cosmetic surfaces and fine crisp detail, vat photopolymerization does better; dyeing and vapor smoothing mitigate the grainy finish but don't erase it. Beyond roughly 5,000–10,000 units of a stable design, injection molding's unit cost is very hard to beat.

## Key numbers

Layer thickness 100–120 µm · tolerance roughly ±0.3 mm or ±0.3% · surface finish Ra 10–15 µm, matte and grainy · minimum wall about 0.7–1 mm · PA12 powder $50–100/kg, with 30–50% virgin refresh per build · machines $20k to $250k with build envelopes of 300–550 mm.

## Examples

Ducts, orthotics, clips, housings, aerospace polymer parts.

## Economic profile

Powder refresh is the cost that surprises people. PA12 at $50–100 per kg needs 30–50% virgin powder added to every build, so the un-melted powder in the bed is not simply reused and the material bill runs well above what the part weighs. Against that, no supports are needed, so the build volume can be packed densely, and packing efficiency is the main lever a service bureau has on price.
