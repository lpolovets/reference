## Description

Production data is analyzed to detect variation, drift, and loss of process capability.

## Strengths and weaknesses

Identifies problems before they create widespread scrap and supports stable high-volume manufacturing. Only works when measurements are reliable and the underlying process is sufficiently understood.

## When to use

Apply SPC to repetitive production of measurable characteristics once the process is capable. A good rule of thumb is to run control charts where Cpk exceeds about 1.33, so sampling can replace 100% inspection, and to chart only the few characteristics that actually predict function rather than everything measurable. It is standard practice, and often contractually required, in automotive and other high-volume supply chains. Two prerequisites really matter: a gauge R&R showing measurement variation well under tolerance, and enough process understanding to act on out-of-control signals rather than tamper. SPC adds little in job shops with lot sizes of a handful, on immature processes still being debugged, or on safety-critical characteristics with marginal capability. In those cases, use 100% inspection or in-process monitoring instead.

## Key numbers

Cpk 1.33 the usual threshold for replacing 100% inspection with sampling, 1.67 for safety-critical characteristics · Cpk 1.33 corresponds to roughly 63 defective parts per million and Cpk 1.67 to under 1 ppm · gauge R&R under 10% of tolerance acceptable, 10–30% marginal, above 30% unusable · control limits at ±3 sigma, giving about one false alarm per 370 points · subgroups of 3–5 parts sampled every 30 minutes to 2 hours · 20–25 subgroups, or 100–125 measurements, to establish limits.

## Examples

Machining dimensions, molding pressure, coating thickness, battery loading, semiconductor critical dimensions.

## Economic profile

This is the one entry here with no equipment cost, bought with engineering time instead. The payoff is explicit: Cpk of 1.33 is the usual threshold for replacing 100% inspection with sampling, so establishing capability converts a per-part inspection cost into a per-lot one. Getting there takes 20–25 subgroups, or 100–125 measurements, before that trade is available. A gauge R&R above 30% of tolerance makes the whole exercise worthless, so measurement capability has to be paid for first.
